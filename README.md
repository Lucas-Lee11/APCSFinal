Execute by using 'java Calculator'

# Evaluator

The evaluator is designed to handle complex numbers.

It will process addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square roots, cos, sin, and tan of complex inputs

Please keep in mind the order of operations and also ensure that there are no implied operations

This calculator uses radians. Use the custom function "torad()" in the input for conversion to radians (e.g. 'sin(torad(30))' will return 0.5 + 0.0i)

Answers can be checked on Wolfram Alpha

Some examples to run
+ (1+2i)^(3+4i)
+ sin(1+3i)
+ ((4 - 2^3 + 1) * -sqrt(-3\*3-4\*4+3i)) ^(2+3i) + cos(torad(30))^2
+ e^(i \* pi)

#Polynomial Equations

This will find the intersection in a Polynomial equation with complex coefficients

Each term uses the evaluator similar to the one already used

#Graphing

This will graph a quadratic using smaller real numbers

#Matrix Calculator

This will take in matrices with rows delimited by newlines and columns by commas

It will add,subtract, and multiply two matrices or multiply by a scalar

It can also find the inverse, determinant, and transpose of a matrix

Given that the second matrix is a column vector, it will solve for Ax = B
